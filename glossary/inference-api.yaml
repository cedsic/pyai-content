  ### 🐍 Python Example: Calling an Inference API

  Here is a simple Python snippet demonstrating how to call an **Inference API** for text classification:

  ```python
  import requests

  API_URL = "https://api.example.com/inference/classify"
  headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
  data = {"text": "Py.AI's Inference API is a game-changer for developers."}

  response = requests.post(API_URL, json=data, headers=headers)
  result = response.json()

  print("Predicted label:", result["label"])
  ```
  <br>
  This example sends a text string to the API's **REST endpoint** with proper authentication, then receives and prints the predicted classification label. It illustrates how developers can integrate AI features with minimal code and infrastructure management.
