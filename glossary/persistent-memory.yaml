description: |
  **Persistent Memory** is a type of **non-volatile memory** that combines the speed and byte-addressability of traditional **RAM** with the durability of storage devices like **SSDs** or **HDDs**. Unlike volatile memory such as **DRAM**, it retains data even when power is lost, enabling faster system recovery and more efficient workflows. This technology creates a new tier in the memory hierarchy, often called **Storage Class Memory (SCM)**, which allows applications to access large datasets directly with minimal latency.

  Key benefits include:  
  - ⚡ **High-speed access:** Near-DRAM speeds with persistent data retention.  
  - 🔄 **State preservation:** Maintains system state across reboots or crashes.  
  - 🛡️ **Improved fault tolerance:** Enables faster recovery and checkpointing.  
  - 🧩 **Optimized resource use:** Reduces complexity in caching and data management.

  ### 🚀 Why Persistent Memory Matters

  The demand for **high-performance computing** in fields like **machine learning**, **data analytics**, and **real-time inference** exposes the limitations of traditional memory-storage hierarchies. Systems typically juggle between fast but volatile **DRAM** and slower but durable storage, causing bottlenecks during data loading or checkpointing.

  Persistent memory addresses these challenges by:  
  - ⏱️ **Reducing latency** with near-DRAM speed and persistence.  
  - 🔄 **Enabling stateful applications** that retain data without expensive reloads.  
  - 🛡️ **Enhancing fault tolerance** to minimize downtime in critical AI systems.  
  - 🧩 **Optimizing workflows** by providing a large, fast, and persistent memory pool.  

  These advantages are foundational for advanced **MLOps** workflows, where **scalability**, **reproducibility**, and **rapid prototyping** are essential.

  ### 🧱 Key Components and Related Concepts

  Persistent memory technology integrates several crucial features and connects with important concepts in AI and computing:  

  - 🧮 **Byte-addressability:** Access memory at the byte level, like RAM, enabling fine-grained data manipulation.  
  - 🔋 **Non-volatility:** Data persists without power, supporting persistent state and faster restarts.  
  - 🗺️ **Memory-mapped I/O:** Applications map persistent memory directly into their address space for simplified programming and accelerated access.  
  - 🔄 **Consistency and atomicity:** Mechanisms ensure data integrity through hardware or software transactional memory.  
  - 🖥️ **Integration with memory hierarchies:** Positioned between **DRAM** and **SSDs**, complementing **GPU acceleration** and **CPU** resources in high-performance systems.  

  Persistent memory also relates closely to concepts such as **caching**, **fault tolerance**, **machine learning pipelines**, **experiment tracking**, **data shuffling**, and **reproducible results**, all of which benefit from its unique properties.

  ### 🐍 Python Example: Memory-Mapped Persistent Storage

  Here is a simple example demonstrating how to use persistent memory for large NumPy arrays via memory-mapped files:

  ```python
  import numpy as np
  import mmap

  # Example: Memory-mapped persistent storage for large NumPy arrays
  filename = "/mnt/pmem/dataset.dat"
  shape = (10000, 1000)

  # Create or open a persistent memory-mapped file
  with open(filename, "r+b") as f:
      mm = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
      data = np.ndarray(shape, dtype=np.float32, buffer=mm)

  # Data can now be accessed as if in RAM but persists across sessions
  print(data[0, 0])
  ```
  <br>
  This code maps a file in persistent memory into the application's address space, allowing **fast, byte-addressable access** to large datasets that persist across sessions, which is critical for efficient AI training workflows.
