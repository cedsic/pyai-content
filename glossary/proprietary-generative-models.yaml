  ### 🧑‍💻 Python Example: Calling a Proprietary Text Generation API

  Below is a simple Python example demonstrating how to interact with a proprietary text generation API (pseudo-code):

  ```python
  import requests

  API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
  endpoint = "https://api.ai21-studio.com/v1/j1-large/complete"

  headers = {
      "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}",
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }

  data = {
      "prompt": "Explain proprietary generative models in simple terms.",
      "maxTokens": 100,
      "temperature": 0.7
  }

  response = requests.post(endpoint, json=data, headers=headers)
  print(response.json()['completions'][0]['data']['text'])
  ```
  <br>
  This code sends a **prompt** to the proprietary API endpoint using an **authorization token** and retrieves a generated text completion. It illustrates how developers can leverage **inference APIs** to access powerful generative capabilities without managing the underlying model infrastructure.
