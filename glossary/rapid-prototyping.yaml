description: |
  **Rapid Prototyping** is an **iterative process** in software and AI development that focuses on quickly building and testing early versions of a product or system. This approach helps teams **validate ideas**, **gather feedback**, and **refine designs** early, which reduces risk and speeds up the time-to-market. In AI and machine learning, rapid prototyping involves assembling components like **data workflows**, **model architectures**, and **experiment setups** to explore feasibility and performance before committing to full-scale development.

  ### 🐍 Python Example: Rapid Prototyping a Simple Neural Network

  Below is a Python snippet demonstrating how to rapidly prototype a binary classification model using **Keras** with minimal setup:

  ```python
  import tensorflow as tf
  from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
  import numpy as np

  # Generate dummy data
  x_train = np.random.random((1000, 20))
  y_train = np.random.randint(2, size=(1000, 1))

  # Define a simple model
  model = models.Sequential([
      layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(20,)),
      layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
  ])

  # Compile the model
  model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                loss='binary_crossentropy',
                metrics=['accuracy'])

  # Train the model quickly
  model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=32)

  # Evaluate prototype performance
  loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_train, y_train)
  print(f"Prototype accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
  ```
  <br>
  This example quickly builds and trains a simple neural network, providing fast insights into model behavior with minimal overhead, ideal for early-stage experimentation.
