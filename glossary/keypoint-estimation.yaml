headline: "Keypoint estimation detects and tracks critical points on objects or bodies to understand shapes, movements, and spatial relationships."
description: |
  **Keypoint Estimation** is a core task in **computer vision** that focuses on detecting and tracking **specific points of interest** within images or videos. These points, known as *keypoints* or *landmarks*, correspond to important features such as **joints on a human body**, **facial landmarks**, or **object parts**. Unlike general object detection that provides bounding boxes, keypoint estimation offers a **more detailed spatial understanding** by pinpointing exact locations.

  Key features of keypoint estimation include:  
  - ✨ **Precise localization** of critical points for deeper analysis  
  - 🔍 Enables tasks like **pose estimation**, **gesture recognition**, and **augmented reality**  
  - 📊 Provides structured data that enhances **machine learning pipelines**

  ### 💻 Example: Real-Time Hand Keypoint Estimation with Python

  Below is a simple Python example demonstrating **real-time hand keypoint estimation** using **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV**:  

  ```python
  import cv2
  import mediapipe as mp

  mp_hands = mp.solutions.hands
  hands = mp_hands.Hands()
  mp_draw = mp.solutions.drawing_utils

  cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
  while cap.isOpened():
      success, img = cap.read()
      if not success:
          break
      img_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
      results = hands.process(img_rgb)

      if results.multi_hand_landmarks:
          for hand_landmarks in results.multi_hand_landmarks:
              mp_draw.draw_landmarks(img, hand_landmarks, mp_hands.HAND_CONNECTIONS)

      cv2.imshow("Hand Keypoint Estimation", img)
      if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == 27:
          break
  cap.release()
  cv2.destroyAllWindows()
  ```

  This example leverages **MediaPipe's** optimized pipeline for detecting hand keypoints, while **OpenCV** handles image capture and visualization, illustrating how these tools can be combined for efficient, real-time keypoint estimation.
