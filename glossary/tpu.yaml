  ### 🖥️ CPU vs GPU vs TPU ⚙️

  ##### <u>CPU</u>

  CPUs (Central Processing Units) and GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are both processors, but they are designed for very different types of workloads. CPUs are optimized for **sequential, general-purpose computing**, with a few powerful cores capable of handling a wide range of tasks efficiently. They excel at tasks that require complex decision-making, branching logic, or running multiple software processes simultaneously. 🧩

  ##### <u>GPU</u>

  In contrast, GPUs are built for **highly parallel computation**, containing hundreds or thousands of smaller cores that can perform many simple calculations simultaneously. This architecture makes GPUs ideal for **matrix operations, neural network training, graphics rendering, and large-scale scientific simulations**. 🎨🧮 While CPUs are essential for running an operating system and general software, GPUs accelerate tasks that can be **parallelized at scale**, such as AI model training and inference, enabling massive speedups that would be impossible on CPUs alone. ⚡

  ##### <u>TPU</u>

  TPUs take this specialization further, being **custom-built for tensor operations** in deep learning. Compared to GPUs, TPUs can perform **certain neural network computations even faster and more energy-efficiently**, especially for models running in cloud environments like Google Cloud. ☁️🔋
