  ### 💡 Sample Code: Blinking an LED with Pythonic Microcontroller Programming

  Here is a simple example using **MicroPython** to blink an LED connected to a microcontroller's GPIO pin:

  ```python
  from machine import Pin
  import time

  # Initialize pin 2 as an output pin
  led = Pin(2, Pin.OUT)

  while True:
      led.value(1)  # Turn LED on
      time.sleep(0.5)
      led.value(0)  # Turn LED off
      time.sleep(0.5)
  ```
