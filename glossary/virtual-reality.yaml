  ### 💻 Illustrative Python Snippet: Simple VR Environment Setup

  Below is a conceptual Python example demonstrating how to set up a basic VR environment by combining **real-time computer vision** with **3D rendering**. This example uses MediaPipe for hand tracking input and PyOpenGL for rendering.

  ```python
  import cv2
  import mediapipe as mp
  from OpenGL.GL import *
  from OpenGL.GLUT import *

  # Initialize MediaPipe hand tracking
  mp_hands = mp.solutions.hands
  hands = mp_hands.Hands()

  # OpenCV video capture for input
  cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

  def render_scene():
      glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT)
      # Render 3D objects here
      glutSwapBuffers()

  def main_loop():
      ret, frame = cap.read()
      if not ret:
          return

      # Process frame for hand landmarks
      results = hands.process(cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
      if results.multi_hand_landmarks:
          for hand_landmarks in results.multi_hand_landmarks:
              # Use hand landmarks to interact with VR scene
