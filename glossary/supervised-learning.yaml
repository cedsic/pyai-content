name: "Supervised Learning"
slug: "supervised-learning"
headline: "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where models are trained on labeled data to predict outcomes or classify new, unseen data."
description: |
  **Supervised Learning** is a fundamental **machine learning** approach where models are trained on **labeled data**—datasets in which each input is paired with the correct output or label. The primary goal is to learn a function that can accurately **predict outcomes** or **classify new, unseen data** based on past examples.
  <br><br>
  Key points to understand:

  - 🏷️ **Labeled Data**: Each example in the dataset includes both input and the correct output.
  - 🎯 **Predictive Modeling**: The model learns to map inputs to outputs to make future predictions.
  - 🔄 **Generalization**: The model aims to perform well on new, unseen data, not just the training set.
  - 🔍 **Contrast with Unsupervised Learning**: Unlike unsupervised learning, supervised learning relies on explicit labels to guide training.

  ### 🐍 Illustrative Python Example

  Below is a simple example demonstrating **supervised learning** using **scikit-learn** to classify the well-known Iris dataset:

  ```python
  from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
  from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
  from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

  # Load labeled data
  iris = load_iris()
  X, y = iris.data, iris.target

  # Split into training and testing sets
  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

  # Initialize a Random Forest classifier
  model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

  # Train the model
  model.fit(X_train, y_train)

  # Predict on test data
  y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

  # Evaluate accuracy
  accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
  print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
  ```
