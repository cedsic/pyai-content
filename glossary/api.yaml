  An **API** (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define how requests and responses should be formatted, enabling seamless interaction between systems.
  Key points to know:
  - **Communication Bridge:** APIs act as intermediaries that facilitate data exchange between different software components.
  - **Standardized Protocols:** They often use standard protocols like HTTP/HTTPS for web-based APIs, ensuring compatibility across platforms.
  - **Data Formats:** Common data formats used in APIs include JSON and XML, which are easy for machines to parse and generate.
  - **Types of APIs:** There are various types of APIs, including RESTful APIs, SOAP APIs, and GraphQL APIs, each with its own design principles and use cases.

  ### 🔍 Common API Types
  Different types of APIs serve various purposes and use cases. Here are some common types:
    | API Type         | Description                                                                        | Example Use Cases                        |
    |------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
    | **RESTful API**  | Uses HTTP requests to access and manipulate resources.                             | Web services, mobile applications        |
    | **SOAP API**     | A protocol for exchanging structured information using XML.                        | Enterprise applications, legacy systems  |
    | **GraphQL API**  | A query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need.  | Flexible data retrieval in web apps      |
    | **WebSocket API**| Enables real-time communication between client and server.                         | Chat applications, live updates          |
