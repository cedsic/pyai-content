  ### 🐍 Code Example: Parallel Processing with Dask ⚙️

  Below is a simple example demonstrating how to distribute a computation-heavy task using **Dask**, a Python library popular in HPC contexts:

  ```python
  import dask.array as da

  # Create a large distributed array
  x = da.random.random((10000, 10000), chunks=(1000, 1000))

  # Perform a computation (mean along axis 0)
  result = x.mean(axis=0)

  # Compute the result in parallel
  computed_result = result.compute()
  print(computed_result)
  ```

  This snippet shows how **data workflows** can be parallelized to speed up large-scale numerical operations, a common pattern in HPC workloads that leverages **parallel processing** to improve performance.
