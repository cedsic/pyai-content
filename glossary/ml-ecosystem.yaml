  from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

  # Load data
  data = load_iris()
  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.data, data.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

  # Start experiment tracking
  with mlflow.start_run():
      clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=3)
      clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
      preds = clf.predict(X_test)
      acc = accuracy_score(y_test, preds)

      # Log model and metrics
      mlflow.sklearn.log_model(clf, "random_forest_model")
      mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", acc)
