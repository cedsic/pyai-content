  ### 🐍 Python Example: Loading a Pretrained Transformer

  Below is a simple Python snippet demonstrating how to load a pretrained Transformer model using the **Hugging Face** library:

  ```python
  from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer

  model_name = "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english"
  tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
  model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)

  text = "Py.AI makes working with trained Transformers accessible and efficient."
  inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")
  outputs = model(**inputs)
  print(outputs.logits)
  ```
  <br>
  This example shows how to quickly load a pretrained model and tokenizer for a **classification task**. The input text is tokenized and converted into tensors, then passed through the model to obtain output logits, facilitating **rapid prototyping** with minimal setup.
