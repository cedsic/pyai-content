  ### 🔎 Why Perception Systems Matter

  **Perception systems** serve as the **sensory front-end** in AI workflows, providing the critical context and situational awareness that AI models require to function effectively. Their importance can be summarized as follows:  

  - 👀 Allow machines to "see," "hear," and "sense" their surroundings, bridging the gap between physical reality and digital understanding  
  - 🚗 Enable safe navigation in applications like autonomous vehicles by detecting pedestrians, traffic signs, and road conditions  
  - 🔗 Support **multimodal AI** by integrating multiple data types (vision, language, audio), enhancing the richness of AI understanding  
  - 📈 Improve performance in diverse fields such as robotics, healthcare, augmented reality, and environmental monitoring

  ### 🐍 Python Example: Simple Image Classification Pipeline

  The following snippet demonstrates a core perception task: **image classification** using a pretrained deep learning model.  

  ```python
  import torch
  from torchvision import models, transforms
  from PIL import Image

  # Load a pretrained deep learning model (ResNet)
  model = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
  model.eval()

  # Define preprocessing steps
  preprocess = transforms.Compose([
      transforms.Resize(256),
      transforms.CenterCrop(224),
      transforms.ToTensor(),
      transforms.Normalize(
          mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], 
          std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
      ),
  ])

  # Load and preprocess image
  img = Image.open("sample.jpg")
  input_tensor = preprocess(img)
  input_batch = input_tensor.unsqueeze(0)  # Create batch dimension

  # Perform inference
  with torch.no_grad():
      output = model(input_batch)

  # Convert output to probabilities
  probabilities = torch.nn.functional.softmax(output[0], dim=0)
  print(probabilities)
  ```
  <br>
  This example loads a **pretrained ResNet model**, preprocesses an input image by resizing and normalizing it, and performs inference to output classification probabilities. It illustrates the integration of **preprocessing** and **model inference** in perception workflows.
