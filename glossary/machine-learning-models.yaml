  ### 💻 Python Example: Training a Simple Classifier
  Here is a straightforward example demonstrating how to train a **random forest classifier** using scikit-learn:

  ```python
  from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
  from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
  from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

  # Load dataset
  data = load_iris()
  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
      data.data, data.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
  )

  # Initialize and train model
  model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
  model.fit(X_train, y_train)

  # Predict and evaluate
  predictions = model.predict(X_test)
  accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
  print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
  ```

  This example illustrates training a **random forest**, a robust and interpretable machine learning model, to classify iris species. The process involves splitting data, fitting the model, and evaluating accuracy on unseen data.
