description: |
  In **artificial intelligence (AI)**, **context** refers to the relevant information, environment, or state that AI systems use to **understand inputs**, **make decisions**, and deliver **meaningful outputs**. It enables AI to move beyond simple rule-based responses, allowing for more **nuanced**, **accurate**, and **adaptable** behavior. Context helps AI systems to:

  - ⚡ **Reduce ambiguity** and improve understanding  
  - 🎯 **Make decisions** aligned with real-world conditions  
  - 🔄 **Adapt dynamically** to changing situations  
  - 🤖 Provide **human-like reasoning** and interaction capabilities

  ### 🔍 Why Context Matters

  Without **context**, AI risks producing **irrelevant** or **incorrect outputs**. It is essential for:

  - Clarifying **ambiguous inputs** to enhance understanding  
  - Supporting **decision-making** that reflects real-world conditions  
  - Allowing AI to **adapt** to new or changing environments  
  - Enabling AI to interact in a more **human-like** manner

  ### 🧩 Key Components and Related Concepts

  **Context in AI** encompasses several interconnected aspects that improve understanding and decision-making:

  - ⚙️ **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):**  
  AI interprets the meaning of words or queries based on surrounding text or conversation history. This is crucial for chatbots and virtual assistants to maintain coherent dialogue and disambiguate terms, linking closely to **natural-language-processing** concepts.  
  - 🧠 **Multi-step Reasoning and Agent Memory:**  
  AI agents maintain context across multiple interactions or reasoning steps, remembering past interactions and adapting suggestions over time. This relates to **multi-agent systems**, **persistent memory**, and **stateful conversations**, enabling complex workflows and coordinated behavior.  
  - 🌍 **Environmental and Temporal Awareness:**  
  Context includes sensor inputs, environmental cues, and temporal sequences influencing AI understanding and predictions. This is important in robotics and **perception systems**, where AI navigates physical spaces or predicts maintenance needs.  
  - 🔗 **Cross-domain Knowledge Integration:**  
  AI combines information from multiple sources or domains to improve inference and understanding. For example, healthcare AI integrates patient history, lab results, and lifestyle factors for better treatment recommendations, illustrating the value of **embeddings** and **multi-modal AI** frameworks.

  Together, these components enable AI systems to consider a broad range of **contextual signals**, resulting in richer and more effective behavior.

  ### 💡 Examples and Use Cases

  - Chatbots distinguishing whether "bank" refers to a financial institution or a riverbank based on **context**.  
  - Streaming platforms suggesting movies based on **viewing history** and time of day.  
  - Autonomous vehicles using **traffic**, road, and weather data to make safe driving decisions.  
  - Robots interpreting **spatial context** and obstacles to navigate factory floors.  
  - Healthcare AI integrating diverse patient data to recommend **accurate treatments**.

  ### 🐍 Example: Using Contextual Embeddings with Python

  The following example demonstrates how to generate **contextual embeddings** from text using a pre-trained transformer model with the Hugging Face Transformers library:

  ```python
  from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel
  import torch

  # Load pre-trained model tokenizer and model
  tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
  model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

  # Example sentence with ambiguous word "bank"
  sentence = "He went to the bank to deposit money."

  # Tokenize input and get contextual embeddings
  inputs = tokenizer(sentence, return_tensors='pt')
  outputs = model(**inputs)

  # Extract the embeddings for the tokens
  embeddings = outputs.last_hidden_state

  print(embeddings.shape)  # (batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)
  ```
  <br>
  This code tokenizes a sentence and generates **contextual embeddings** that capture the meaning of words based on their surrounding text. These embeddings can be used in downstream tasks such as classification or question answering, enabling AI models to understand **context** effectively.
