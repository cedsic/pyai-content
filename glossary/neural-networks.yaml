  ### 💻 Python Example
  Here is a simple example illustrating a feedforward neural network built with **TensorFlow** and **Keras**:

  ```python
  import tensorflow as tf
  from tensorflow.keras import layers

  # Simple feedforward neural network example
  model = tf.keras.Sequential([
      layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),
      layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
      layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
  ])

  model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                metrics=['accuracy'])
  ```
  <br>
  This code defines a neural network with two hidden layers using the ReLU activation function and an output layer with softmax for multi-class classification. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and a suitable loss function for sparse categorical data, preparing it for training on labeled datasets.
