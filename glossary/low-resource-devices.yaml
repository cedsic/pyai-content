  # Load the TensorFlow Lite model (quantized)
  interpreter = tf.lite.Interpreter(model_path="model_quantized.tflite")
  interpreter.allocate_tensors()

  # Get input and output tensors.
  input_details = interpreter.get_input_details()
  output_details = interpreter.get_output_details()

  # Prepare a dummy input matching the model's input shape
  input_data = np.array(np.random.random_sample(input_details[0]['shape']), dtype=np.float32)

  # Set the tensor to point to the input data
  interpreter.set_tensor(input_details[0]['index'], input_data)

  # Run inference
  interpreter.invoke()

  # Retrieve the output of the model
  output_data = interpreter.get_tensor(output_details[0]['index'])
  print("Model output:", output_data)
  ```
