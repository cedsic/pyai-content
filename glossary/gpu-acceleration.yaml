description: |
  **GPU acceleration** leverages **Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)** to perform **parallel computations** (e.g., in AI, scientific computing, and **VFX rendering**), allowing programs to process **large datasets, complex neural networks, and high-throughput numerical operations** far faster than CPUs.  
  This approach is widely used in AI, deep learning, scientific computing, and large-scale Python workloads, especially those that are **XLA-optimized** for further computational efficiency.
