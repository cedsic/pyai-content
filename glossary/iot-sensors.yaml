  ### 🐍 Sample Python Code: Reading and Visualizing IoT Sensor Data

  Below is a simple example demonstrating how to load, process, and plot temperature sensor data using **pandas** and **Matplotlib**:

  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  # Simulated sensor data: timestamps and temperature readings
  data = {
      'timestamp': pd.date_range(start='2024-01-01', periods=100, freq='H'),
      'temperature_celsius': 20 + 5 * pd.np.sin(pd.np.linspace(0, 10, 100)) + pd.np.random.normal(0, 0.5, 100)
  }

  df = pd.DataFrame(data)
  df.set_index('timestamp', inplace=True)

  # Plot temperature over time
  plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
  plt.plot(df.index, df['temperature_celsius'], label='Temperature (°C)')
  plt.title('IoT Sensor Temperature Readings')
  plt.xlabel('Time')
  plt.ylabel('Temperature (°C)')
  plt.legend()
  plt.grid(True)
  plt.show()
  ```
