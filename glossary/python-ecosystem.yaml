  ### 💻 Python Code Example: Building a Classification Model

  Here is a simple example demonstrating how to load data, train a classification model, and evaluate its accuracy using Python:

  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
  from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

  # Load dataset
  data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
  X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
  y = data['target']

  # Split data
  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=42)

  # Train model
  model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
  model.fit(X_train, y_train)

  # Predict and evaluate
  predictions = model.predict(X_test)
  print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, predictions):.2f}")
  ```
  <br>
  This example uses **pandas** to load and prepare data, splits it for training and testing, trains a **RandomForestClassifier** from **scikit-learn**, and evaluates the model’s accuracy, illustrating a typical workflow in the Python Ecosystem.
