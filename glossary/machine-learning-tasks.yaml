  ### 🧩 Key Components & Related Concepts

  **Machine learning tasks** are categorized by the type of data and learning involved, closely connected with foundational concepts that support their success:  

  - **Supervised Learning** 🧑‍🏫  
      - Uses **labeled data** to learn input-output mappings.  
      - Tasks include **classification** (assigning discrete labels) and **regression** (predicting continuous values).  

  - **Unsupervised Learning** 🕵️‍♂️  
      - Works with **unlabeled data** to find hidden structures.  
      - Includes **clustering** (grouping similar data points) and **dimensionality reduction** (simplifying data).  

  - **Reinforcement Learning** 🎮  
      - Models learn by interacting with an environment to maximize rewards, ideal for sequential decision-making tasks.  

  - **Semi-Supervised and Self-Supervised Learning** 🔄  
      - Combine labeled and unlabeled data to improve learning when labels are scarce.  

  - **Anomaly Detection** 🚨

  ### 🐍 Example: Classification with Python and scikit-learn

  Below is a simple example demonstrating a **supervised learning** task—**classification**—using the **random forests** algorithm with Python’s **scikit-learn** library:

  ```python
  from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
  from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
  from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

  # Load dataset
  data = load_iris()
  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.data, data.target, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

  # Train classifier
  clf = RandomForestClassifier()
  clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

  # Predict and evaluate
  predictions = clf.predict(X_test)
  print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, predictions):.2f}")
  ```

  This snippet trains a **random forest classifier** on the Iris dataset, then evaluates its accuracy on a test set. It highlights how **supervised learning** models learn from labeled data to make predictions on unseen examples.
