## 🧠 py.ai Content Repository

Welcome to the Py.AI content repository — the open-source database that powers the [Py.AI](https://py.ai) website.

Py.AI is a community-driven knowledge source focused on Python 🐍 and Artificial Intelligence 🤖.  
Its purpose is to gather clear, structured information about:

- 🧩 Tools and frameworks in Python and AI
- 📘 Glossary terms that explain key AI concepts

All content is stored in YAML files and periodically synchronized with the py.ai website.
As the community grows, we may extend the website with tutorials, examples, and contributor recognition features.
